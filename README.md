# Animal-Shelter-Database-System
This project is a relational database design for QUELIFE, an animal shelter organization with branches across Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, California, Texas, and Nevada. The goal is to streamline data management related to shelters, animals, employees, sponsors, medical history, and adoptions using a well-normalized schema.
